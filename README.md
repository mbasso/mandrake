### What is a Mandrake?

- Element: Fire
- Planet: Mercury, Uranus and Pluto.
- Powers: Protection, Fertility, Money, Love, Health

Mandrake is a long leafed dark green plant with small greenish-yellow or purple bell-shaped flowers. The flowers eventually fruit into small orange-coloured fleshy berries.
Magically speaking, the female mandrake carries forked that look like a pair of human legs, whereas the male has only a single root.
In the old Herbals we find them frequently figured as a male with a long beard, and a female with a very bushy head of hair.
The female form is the most sought after for magic and medicinal use.
A whole Mandrake root placed in the home, will give the house protection, fertility, and prosperity. Also, where there is Mandrake, demons cannot abide. Money placed beside the root is said to multiply.
